            Samples contain full open source code and details on
            logic, as well as "keep it simple stupid" as an ingrained

            Code doesn't have to be complicated. Examples should be comprehensive
            but not turing-complete. A sample should show you how to paint a red fence,

            These experiments work across as many browsers as possible
            (dependant APIs permitting). With a focus on <i>ignoring</i>
            Internet Explorer, Safari, and Firefox, we can cover all
            use-cases with minimal browser vendor quirks.
